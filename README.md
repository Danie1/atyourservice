# AtYourService Project
The atyourservice project is intended to provide highly-customizable utilities for troubleshooting issues.

Some of these utilities compliment one another, thus gathering them under one repository allows for a shared standard in the future.

Supported projects include:
- [nurse](nurse/README.md) - a command-line tool to retrieve diagnostic information from user's environments with their consent.
